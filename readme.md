# Whatsapp Desktop

Whatsapp desktop client for OSX, based on the official whatsapp web app. Build with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).  

This is **NOT** an official product. This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the WhatsApp API or attempt to reimplement any part of the WhatsApp client. Any communication between the user and WhatsApp servers is handled by official WhatsApp Web itself; this is just a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web, like a browser.

## Features

* Native notifications.  
* System tray icon.  
* Open links in browser.  

**Planned features:**  

* Badge with the number of notifications in the dock/taskbar.  
* Auto-launch on OS startup.  
* Windows and Linux builds.
